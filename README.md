# Spectral Embedder
Program for the spectral embedding of networks into Euclidean space. This program is capable of embedding directed[1] and undirected networks, both weighted and unweighted. The embedding is done through the random walk Laplacian transforming the adjacency matrix (which can be symmetrized).

## Runnings
First run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To run the spectral embedder, follow the example in `test.py`.
